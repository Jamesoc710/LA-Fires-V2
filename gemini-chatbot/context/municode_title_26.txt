## APPENDIX A - Legislative History for Ordinance 2225. Ordinance 2225, the Building Code for Los Angeles County, was originally adopted on March 20, 1933. Ordinance 2225 was kept up to date by frequent amendments until the entire Building Code was repealed and replaced by Ordinance 95-0065. Major amendments to Ordinance 2225, each adopting the current edition of the Uniform Building Code, are listed and briefly described in Table 1 below; ordinances amending them are also listed. Table 2 covers the legislative history of the county's own Building Code provisions before Ordinance 95-0065 was passed, and gives the specific legislative history for each section. Some repealed material is included for continuity. Table 3 shows the correspondence between sections of the 1991 Uniform Building Code and the 1994 Uniform Building Code. The 1991 Uniform Building Code was extensively revised and renumbered to create the 1994 Uniform Building Code. Provisions of Ordinance 95-0065 and its amendments, along with Ords. 2913, 10120, 10232, 11419, and later ordinances on fire zones, now comprise [Title 26](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO) of the Los Angeles County Code.

## APPENDIX J - GRADING ### SECTION J101 - GENERAL #### J101.1 Scope. The provisions of this Appendix apply to grading, excavation, and earthwork construction, including fills and embankments, and the control of runoff from graded sites, including erosion sediments and construction-related pollutants. The purpose of this Appendix is to safeguard life, limb, property, and the public welfare by regulating grading on property subject to this Code. ([Ord. 2022-0051](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/ordinances/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=1186263) § 69, 2022.) #### J101.2 Flood hazard areas. Unless the applicant has submitted a hydrology and hydraulic analysis, prepared in accordance with standard engineering practice by a California licensed civil engineer, that demonstrates the proposed work will not result in any increase in the level of the base flood, grading, excavation and earthwork construction, including fills and embankments, shall not be permitted in floodways designated in [Chapter 11.60](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT11HESA_DIV3MIRE_CH11.60FLWASUELARSPFLHA) of [Title 11](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT11HESA) - Health and Safety - of the Los Angeles County Code, or in floodways that are in flood hazard areas established in Section 1612.3 or in flood hazard areas where design flood elevations are specified but floodways have not been designated. ([Ord. 2022-0051](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/ordinances/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=1186263) § 69, 2022.) #### J101.3 General hazards. Whenever the Building Official determines that any existing excavation, embankment, or fill on property subject to this Code has become a hazard to life and limb, or endangers property, or adversely affects the safety, use, or stability of a public way or drainage channel, the Building Official may give written notice thereof to the owner of the property upon which the excavation, embankment, or fill is located, or other person or agent in control of said property. Upon receipt of said notice, the owner or other person or agent in control of the property shall repair, eliminate, or secure such excavation, embankment, or fill so as to eliminate the hazard, in conformance with the requirements of this Code, within the period specified in said notice. ([Ord. 2022-0051](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/ordinances/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=1186263) § 69, 2022.) #### J101.4 Safety precautions. If at any stage of the work the Building Official determines by inspection that unpermitted grading or grading work pursuant to a grading permit is likely to endanger any public or private property, or result in the deposition of debris on any public way, or interfere with any existing drainage course, the Building Official may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in doing such work or causing such work to be done, and any such person shall immediately stop such work. The Building Official may authorize the work to proceed if the Building Official finds that adequate safety precautions can be taken or corrective measures incorporated in the work to avoid likelihood of such danger, deposition, or interference. If the grading work as done was performed without a grading permit or has created or resulted in a hazardous condition, the Building Official shall give written notice requiring correction thereof as specified in Section J103 and Section J101 of this Code. ([Ord. 2022-0051](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/ordinances/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=1186263) § 69, 2022.) #### J101.5 Protection of utilities. Both the permittee and the owner of the property on which the grading is performed shall be responsible for the prevention of damage to any public and/or private utilities or services. ([Ord. 2022-0051](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/ordinances/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=1186263) § 69, 2022.) #### J101.6 Protection of adjacent property. Both the permittee and owner of the property on which the grading is performed shall be responsible for the prevention of damage to adjacent property. No person shall excavate on land sufficiently close to the property line to endanger any adjoining public street, sidewalk, alley, or other public or private property without taking adequate measures to support and protect such property from settling, cracking, or other damage that might result from the proposed work. Any person performing any grading that involves imported or exported materials shall take special precautions, as approved by the Building Official, to prevent such materials from being deposited on adjacent properties, any public way, and/or any drainage course. ([Ord. 2022-0051](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/ordinances/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=1186263) § 69, 2022.) #### J101.7 Storm water control measures. Both the permittee and the owner of the property on which the grading is performed shall put into effect and maintain all precautionary measures necessary to protect adjacent water courses and public or private property from damage by erosion, flooding, and deposition of mud, debris, and construction-related pollutants originating from the site during grading and related construction activities. ([Ord. 2022-0051](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/ordinances/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=1186263) § 69, 2022.) #### J101.8 Maintenance of protective devices and rodent control. All drainage structures and other protective devices and all burrowing rodent control measures, as shown on the grading plans approved by the Building Official, shall be maintained in a good condition and, when necessary, promptly repaired by the permittee or the owner of the property on which grading has been performed or by any other person or agent in control of such property.

For the purposes of this Section certain terms are defined as follows: BASE LEVEL DIAPHRAGM is the floor at, or closest to, the top of the highest level of the foundation. DIAPHRAGM ANCHORS are assemblies that connect a diaphragm to the adjacent foundation at the uphill diaphragm edge. DOWNHILL DIRECTION is the descending direction of the slope approximately perpendicular to the slope contours. FOUNDATION is concrete or masonry that supports a building, including footings, stem walls, retaining walls, and grade beams. FOUNDATION EXTENDING IN THE DOWNHILL DIRECTION is a foundation running downhill and approximately perpendicular to the uphill foundation. HILLSIDE BUILDING is any building or portion thereof constructed on or into a slope steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33.3 percent). If only a portion of the building is supported on or into the slope, these regulations apply to the entire building. PRIMARY ANCHORS are diaphragm anchors designed for and providing a direct connection as described in Sections 1613.6.5 and 1613.6.7.3 between the diaphragm and the uphill foundation. SECONDARY ANCHORS are diaphragm anchors designed for and providing a redundant diaphragm to foundation connection, as described in Sections 1613.6.6 and 1613.6.7.4. UPHILL DIAPHRAGM EDGE is the edge of the diaphragm adjacent and closest to the highest ground level at the perimeter of the diaphragm. UPHILL FOUNDATION is the foundation parallel and closest to the uphill diaphragm edge.

For the purpose of this Section, known active earthquake faults are those faults which have had displacement within Holocene time (approximately the last 11,000 years) as defined in the most current issue of Special Publication 42 of the California Geological Survey. (Ord. 2007-0108 § 2 (part), 2007; Ord. 95-0065 § 3 (part), 1995.) #### 113.5 Construction Limitations. No building or structure shall be constructed over or upon the trace of a known active earthquake fault which is shown on maps maintained by the Building Official. These maps include, but are not limited to, earthquake fault zone maps prepared under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Public Resources Code. The absence of a known active earthquake fault trace at the proposed building location shall be determined by a professional geologist licensed in the State of California in the following cases: 1. When the proposed building is within (50) feet (15.24 m) of that line designated by the Building Official as the assumed location of a known active earthquake fault on the aforementioned maps. 2. When the proposed building is within 50 feet (15.24 m) of the most probable ground location of the trace of a known active earthquake fault shown on the aforementioned maps. In these cases the Building Official may require the excavation of a trench, for the purpose of determining the existence of an active earthquake fault. Such a trench will be required if a lack of distinguishable fault features in the vicinity prevents the Building Official from determining by a site examination, review of available aerial photographs, or by other means that the fault trace does not underlie the proposed building. The trench shall be approximately perpendicular to the most probable direction of the fault trace, at least 1-1/2 feet (0.15 m) wide, and at least five feet in depth measured from natural grade, or to a depth satisfactory to the Building Official. The trench must be accessible for mapping and inspection by the Building Official, when requested, and meet the requirements of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations, Construction Safety Orders. The trench need not extend further than the full width of the proposed structure plus 5 feet (1.52 m) beyond the traversed exterior walls. A known active earthquake fault shall be presumed nonexistent if an exposure is not found by the professional geologist in the walls or floor of the trench. The Building Official may require a more extensive investigation by a professional geologist as evidence to the absence of a known active earthquake fault prior to the issuance of a permit for Groups A, E, I, H and R, Division 1 Occupancies and B, F, M and S Occupancies over one story in height. The results of the investigation, conclusions and recommendations shall be presented in a geology report prepared by a professional geologist as defined by Section [113.3](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT29MECO_CH1AD_PTIGEPR_113.3SURE). The report shall comply with the guidelines presented in Note 49 prepared by the California Department of Conservation, Geological Survey. The Building Official may waive the requirements for an active earthquake fault investigation for additions to existing one- or two-family dwelling units when all of the following conditions are met: 1. There is no increase in the number of bedrooms or bedroom equivalent rooms in the dwelling unit; 2. The addition does not increase the permitted gross floor area of the structure by more than 20 percent as it existed on January 1, 2017, or 400 square feet, whichever is less; 3. The Building Official has determined that the addition is not located over or upon the trace of a known active earthquake fault as shown on the aforementioned maps; and 4. The owner shall record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder a statement acknowledging that the owner is aware that the records of the Building Official indicate that the property is potentially subject to a hazard from a known active earthquake fault. The owner shall also record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder an agreement relieving the County and all officers and employees thereof of any liability for any damage or loss which may result from the issuance of such a permit. This agreement shall provide that it is binding on all successors in interest of the owner and shall continue in effect until the Building Official records in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder a statement that the Building Official has determined that a hazard from a known active earthquake fault no longer exists. EXCEPTION: The provisions of this Section do not apply to: 1.

## CHAPTER 94 - REPAIR OF WELDED STEEL MOMENT FRAME BUILDINGS LOCATED IN HIGH EARTHQUAKE DAMAGED AREAS [Title 26](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO) of the Los Angeles County Code is amended by adding [Chapter 94](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH94REWESTMOFRBULOHIEADAAR), entitled "REPAIR OF WELDED STEEL MOMENT FRAME BUILDINGS LOCATED IN HIGH EARTHQUAKE DAMAGED AREAS," to read as follows: ### SECTION 9401 - PURPOSE This Chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification of welded steel moment frame buildings, and time periods under which these buildings are required to be structurally inspected and repaired. Where inspection finds damage, this Chapter requires the building to be repaired or demolished. This Chapter sets forth minimum standards for structural seismic resistance to reduce the risk of loss of life and injury by the inspection and repair of lateral load resisting welded steel moment frame connections. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury, or prevent earthquake damage to repaired buildings. This Chapter does not require existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire safety systems to be altered. (Ord. 99-0040 § 73 (part), 1999.) ### SECTION 9402 - SCOPE #### 9402.1 Scope. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all welded steel moment frame buildings constructed, under construction, or for which a building permit was issued prior to July 1, 1999, the effective date of Ordinance 99-0040, which are: 1. Publicly-owned and provide essential response and recovery services to the general public in the event of a disaster or emergency, regardless of their location, or 2. Publicly-owned and provide unique and essential public services which ensure that law and order is maintained in the event of a disaster, such as jails, detention facilities, and courthouses, or 3. Located within the following earthquake high-damage areas. (Ord. 2013-0048 § 77, 2013; Ord. 2002-0076 § 139, 2002; Ord. 99-0040 § 73 (part), 1999.) #### 9402.2 Earthquake High Damage Areas. The January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake high-damage areas are defined as: 1. That unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County known as Universal City and bounded by the Los Angeles River and the City of Los Angeles on the north, and bounded on the east, south and west by westerly, northerly and easterly boundaries of the City of Los Angeles. 2. That unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County bounded on the south by the northerly boundary of the City of Los Angeles, bounded on the west by the easterly boundary of Ventura County, bounded on the north by State Highway 126, and bounded on the East and North by the westerly and southerly boundaries of the City of Santa Clarita and the Antelope Valley Freeway. (Ord. 99-0040 § 73 (part), 1999.) #### 9402.3 Preliminary Identification of Buildings. Preliminary identification of buildings under the scope of this Chapter shall include the following: 1. Field survey; 2. Review of construction documents on file with the Building Official. (Ord. 99-0040 § 73 (part), 1999.) ### SECTION 9403 - DEFINITIONS For purposes of this Chapter, the applicable definitions identified in Chapter 16 of this Code and the following definitions apply: WELDED STEEL MOMENT FRAME is a form of steel building where lateral loads are resisted, in part, by welded beam-to-column connections designed to resist bending moments. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 85, 2016; Ord. 2007-0108 § 29 (part), 2007; Ord. 99-0040 § 73 (part), 1999.) ### SECTION 9404 - ADMINISTRATION #### 9404.1 Service of Order.

## CHAPTER 95 - EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION FOR EXISTING CONCRETE TILT-UP BUILDINGS [Title 26](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO) of the Los Angeles County Code is amended by adding [Chapter 95](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH95EAHAREEXCOTIBU), entitled "EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION FOR EXISTING CONCRETE TILT-UP BUILDINGS," to read as follows: ### SECTION 9501 - PURPOSE The purpose of this Chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury which might otherwise result from earthquake damage to concrete tilt-up buildings constructed, under construction, or for which a building permit was issued prior to April 13, 1975. Such buildings have been widely recognized as having a potentially significant risk of sustaining life-hazardous damage, including partial or complete collapse during moderate to strong earthquakes, due to inadequate wall anchorage to the horizontal diaphragm. This Chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification of such concrete tilt-up wall buildings, and time periods under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and anchored. Where analysis finds deficiencies, this Chapter requires the building to be strengthened or demolished. This Chapter sets forth minimum standards for structural seismic resistance to reduce the risk of loss of life and injury by the installation of wall anchors and connections to the horizontal diaphragms. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury, or prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated buildings. This Chapter does not require existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire protection systems to be altered. (Ord. 2013-0048 § 80, 2013; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) ### SECTION 9502 - SCOPE The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all tilt-up concrete wall buildings with flexible diaphragms constructed, under construction, or for which a building permit was issued prior to April 13, 1975. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 86, 2016; Ord. 2007-0108 § 30 (part), 2007; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) ### SECTION 9503 - DEFINITIONS For purposes of this Chapter, the applicable definitions contained in this Code and the following definitions shall apply: ESSENTIAL FACILITIES is defined as any building conforming to the definition of essential facilities as set forth in Chapter 2. FLEXIBLE DIAPHRAGMS is defined as roofs and floors such as those sheathed with plywood, wood decking (1-by or 2-by) or metal decks without concrete topping slabs. TILT-UP CONCRETE WALL is a form of precast concrete panel construction, where the panel is either cast at the construction site in a horizontal position, or offsite and, after curing, incorporated into the structure of the building, in a vertical position. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 87, 2016; Ord. 2013-0048 § 81, 2013; Ord. 2007-0108 § 30 (part), 2007; Ord. 2002-0076 § 146, 2002; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) ### SECTION 9504 - ADMINISTRATION #### 9504.1 Service of Order.

If such a structural analysis indicates that the building does not meet the requirements of this Chapter, the owner shall either obtain a demolition permit and demolish the building or submit plans for structural alterations of the building so that it will comply with the provisions of this Chapter together with a structural analysis so indicating, and perform the work. The owner shall submit the required structural analysis, obtain any necessary permits and commence and complete the required alteration or demolition within the time limits set forth in Table 95-A. These time limits shall run from the date the Earthquake Hazard Reduction Compliance Order is served. Once an Earthquake Hazard Reduction Compliance Order has been served, buildings within the scope of this Chapter may not be structurally altered, remodeled or added to without first complying with the provisions of this Chapter unless the Building Official determines that the alteration is minor in nature. (Ord. 2002-0076 § 152, 2002; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) #### 9505.2 Alteration and repairs. Alterations and repairs required to meet the provisions of this Chapter shall comply with applicable structural requirements of this Code unless specifically modified in this Chapter. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 88, 2016.) #### 9505.3 Requirements for plans. The plans shall accurately reflect the results of the engineered investigation and design and shall show all pertinent dimensions and sizes for plan review and construction. The following shall be provided: 1. Floor plans and roof plans shall show existing framing construction, diaphragm construction, proposed wall anchors, cross-ties and collectors. Existing nailing, anchors, cross-ties and collectors shall also be shown on the plans if they are considered part of the lateral force-resisting systems. 2. At elevations where there are alterations or damage, details shall show roof and floor heights, dimensions of openings, locations and extent of existing alterations or damage and proposed repairs. 3. Typical wall panel details and sections with panel thickness, height, pilasters and location of anchors shall be provided. 4. Details shall include existing and new anchors and the method of developing anchor forces into the diaphragm framing, existing and/or new cross-ties, and existing and/or new or improved support of roof and floor girders at pilasters or walls. 5. The basis for design and the applicable Building Code used for the design shall be stated on the plans. 6. Plans submitted pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall be signed by the licensed civil or structural engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the building and shall comply with the requirements of this Code and this Section. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 88, 2016.) #### 9505.4 Structural observation, testing, inspection. Structural observation, in accordance with Section 1704.6, shall be required for all structures in which seismic retrofit is being performed in accordance with this Chapter. Structural observation shall include visual observation of work for conformance to the approved construction documents and confirmation of existing conditions assumed during design. Structural testing and inspection for new construction materials shall be in accordance with this Code, except as modified by this Chapter. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 88, 2016.) ### SECTION 9506 - ANALYSIS AND DESIGN #### 9506.1 Reinforced Concrete and Reinforced Masonry Wall Anchorage. Concrete and masonry walls shall be anchored to all floors and roofs which provide lateral support for the wall. The anchorage shall provide a positive direct connection between the wall and floor or roof construction capable of resisting 75 percent of the horizontal forces specified in [Section 1613](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH16STDE_S1613EALO) of this Code. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016; Ord. 2007-0108 § 30 (part), 2007; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) #### 9506.2 Special Requirements for Wall Anchorage Systems. The steel elements of the wall anchorage system shall be designed in accordance with this Code without the use of the 1.33 short duration allowable stress increase when using allowable stress design. Wall anchors shall be provided to resist out-of-plane forces, independent of existing shear anchors. Exception: Existing cast-in-place shear anchors may be used as wall anchors if the tie element can be readily attached to the anchors and if the engineer or architect can establish tension values for the existing anchors through the use of approved as-built plans or testing, and thorough analysis showing that the bolts are capable of resisting the total shear load (including dead load) while being acted upon by the maximum tension force due to earthquake. Criteria for analysis and testing shall be determined by the Building Official. Expansion anchors are only allowed with special inspection and approved testing for seismic loading. Attaching the edge of plywood sheathing to steel ledgers does not comply with the positive anchoring requirements of this Chapter. Attaching the edge of steel decks to steel ledgers is not considered as providing the positive anchorage of this Chapter unless testing and/or analysis is performed to establish shear values for the attachment perpendicular to the edge of the deck. Where steel decking is used as a wall anchor system, the existing connections shall be subject to field verification and the new connections shall be subject to special inspection. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016; Ord. 2013-0048 § 82, 2013; Ord. 2007-0108 § 30 (part), 2007; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) #### 9506.3 Development of Anchor Loads into the Diaphragm. Development of anchor loads into roof and floor diaphragms shall comply with [Section 1613](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH16STDE_S1613EALO) of this Code, using horizontal forces that are 75 percent of those used for new construction. Exception: If continuously tied girders are present, then the maximum allowable spacing between the continuity ties is the greater of the girder spacing or 24 feet (7314 mm). Added chords of diaphragms may be used to form subdiaphragms to transmit the anchorage forces to the main continuous cross-ties. The maximum shear used to determine the depth of the subdiaphragm shall not exceed 75 percent of the maximum diaphragm shear. In wood diaphragms, anchorage shall not be accomplished by use of toenails or nails subject to withdrawal. Wood ledgers, top plates or framing shall not be used in cross-grain bending or cross-grain tension. The continuous ties required by [Section 1613](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH16STDE_S1613EALO) of this Code shall be in addition to the diaphragm sheathing. Lengths of development of anchor loads in wood diaphragms shall be based on existing field nailing of the sheathing unless existing edge nailing is positively identified on the original construction plans or at the site. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016; Ord. 2010-0053 § 81, 2010; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) #### 9506.4 Anchorage at Pilasters. Anchorage of pilasters shall be designed for the tributary wall anchoring load per Section 9506.1 of this Code, considering the wall as a two-way slab. The edges of the two-way slab shall be considered fixed when there is continuity at pilasters and shall be considered pinned at roof and floor. The pilasters or the walls immediately adjacent to the pilasters shall be anchored directly to the roof framing such that the existing vertical anchor bolts at the top of the pilasters are by-passed without permitting tension or shear failure at the top of the pilasters. Exception: If existing vertical anchor bolts at the top of the pilasters are used for the anchorage, then additional exterior confinement shall be provided as required to resist the total anchorage force. The minimum anchorage force at a floor or roof between the pilasters shall be that specified in Section 9506.1 of this Code. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016; Ord. 99-0040 § 74 (part), 1999.) #### 9506.5 Symmetry. Symmetry of wall anchorage and continuity connectors about the minor axis of the framing member is required. Exception: Eccentricity may be allowed when it can be shown that all components of forces are positively resisted. The resistance must be supported by calculations or tests. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016.) #### 9506.6 Combination of Anchor Types. New anchors used in combination on a single framing member shall be of compatible behavior and stiffness. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016.) #### 9506.7 Anchorage at Interior Walls. Existing interior reinforced concrete or reinforced masonry walls that extend to the floor above or to the roof diaphragm shall be anchored for out-of-plane forces per Sections 9506.1 and 9506.3. Walls extending through the roof diaphragm shall be anchored for out-of-plane forces on both sides, and continuity ties shall be spliced across or continuous through the interior wall to provide diaphragm continuity. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016.) #### 9506.8 Collectors. If collectors are not present at reentrant corners or interior shear walls, they shall be provided. Existing or new collectors shall be designed for the capacity required to develop into the diaphragm a force equal to the lesser of the rocking or shear capacity of the reentrant wall or the tributary shear based on 75 percent of the horizontal forces specified in Chapter 16 of this Code. The capacity of the collector need not exceed the capacity of the diaphragm to deliver loads to the collector. A connection shall be provided from the collector to the reentrant wall to transfer the full collector force (load). If a truss or beam other than a rafter or purlin is supported by the reentrant wall or by a column integral with the reentrant wall, then an independent secondary column is required to support the roof or floor members whenever rocking or shear capacity of the reentrant wall is less than the tributary shear. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 89, 2016.) #### 9506.9 Mezzanines. Existing mezzanines relying on reinforced concrete or reinforced masonry walls for vertical and/or lateral support shall be anchored to the walls for the tributary mezzanine load. Walls depending on the mezzanine for lateral support shall be anchored per Sections 9506.1, 9506.2 and 9506.3. Exception: Existing mezzanines that have independent lateral and vertical support need not be anchored to the walls.

## CHAPTER 96 - EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION FOR EXISTING UNREINFORCED MASONRY BEARING WALL BUILDINGS [Title 26](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO) of the Los Angeles County Code is amended by adding [Chapter 96](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH96EAHAREEXUNMABEWABU), entitled "EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION FOR EXISTING UNREINFORCED MASONRY BEARING WALL BUILDINGS," to read as follows: ### SECTION 9601 - PURPOSE This Chapter promotes public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury otherwise resulting from earthquake damage to certain buildings constructed before March 20, 1933, which have insufficient resistance to moderate or strong earthquakes. The provisions of this Chapter constitute minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life and injury. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing building. This Chapter shall not require existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical, or fire safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or property. This Chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of these buildings based on their present use. Priorities, time periods, and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and anchored. Where the analysis identifies deficiencies, this Chapter requires the building to be strengthened or demolished. (Ord. 2013-0048 § 85, 2013; Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) ### SECTION 9602 - SCOPE The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to buildings which, prior to March 20, 1933, were constructed or were under construction and which have unreinforced masonry bearing walls as defined herein. This Chapter shall also apply to buildings for which a building permit was issued prior to March 20, 1933, and which have unreinforced masonry bearing walls as defined herein. EXCEPTION: This Chapter shall not apply to dwellings and lodging houses defined as Group R-3 Occupancies nor to accessory buildings defined as Group U Occupancies. (Ord. 2013-0048 § 85, 2013; Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) ### SECTION 9603 - DEFINITIONS For purposes of this Chapter, the applicable definitions contained in this Code, Appendix Chapter A1 of the Existing Building Code, and the following definitions shall apply: ESSENTIAL BUILDING. An essential building under the scope of this Chapter is defined as any building conforming to the definition of essential facilities as set forth in this Code. HIGH-RISK BUILDING. A high-risk building is any building, other than an essential building, having an occupant load of 100 or more as determined by Chapter 10 of this Code. EXCEPTION: A high-risk building shall not include the following: 1. Any building having exterior walls braced with masonry crosswalls or woodframe crosswalls spaced less than 40 feet (12192 mm) apart in each story. Crosswalls shall be full-story height with a minimum length of 1-1/2 times the story height. 2. Any building used for its intended purpose, as determined by the building official, for less than 20 hours per week. HISTORICAL BUILDING. A historical building is any building designated as a historical building by the federal, state, or County government or an agency thereof. LOW-RISK BUILDING. A low-risk building is any building, other than an essential building, having an occupant load of less than 20 as determined by Chapter 10 of this Code. MEDIUM-RISK BUILDING. A medium-risk building is any building, not classified as a high-risk building or an essential building, having an occupant load of 20 or more as determined by Chapter 10 of this Code. (Ord. 2016-0053 § 92, 2016; Ord. 2013-0048 § 85, 2013; Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) ### SECTION 9604 - RATING CLASSIFICATIONS The rating classifications identified in Table 96-A are hereby established and each building within the scope of this Chapter shall be placed in one such rating classification by the Building Official. The total occupant load of the entire building as determined by Chapter 10 of this Code shall be used to determine the rating classification. EXCEPTION: For purposes of this Chapter, portions of buildings constructed to act independently when resisting seismic forces may be placed in separate rating classifications. (Ord. 2013-0048 § 85, 2013; Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) ### SECTION 9605 - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS #### 9605.1 Time limitations. The owner of each building within the scope of this Chapter shall, upon service of an order and within the time limits set forth in this Chapter, cause a structural analysis to be made of the building by a licensed civil or structural engineer or architect. If the building does not comply with standards specified in this Chapter and Appendix Chapter A1 of the Existing Building Code, then the owner shall cause the building to be structurally altered to conform to such standards or shall cause the building to be demolished. The owner of a building within the scope of this Chapter shall comply with the requirements set forth above by submitting plans that comply with the requirements of [Section 9608](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH96EAHAREEXUNMABEWABU_S9608INREPL) to the Building Official for review within the stated time limits of the following items: 1.

The Building Official shall, in accordance with the priorities set forth in Table 96-C, issue an order as provided in this Section to the owner of each building within the scope of this Chapter. Prior to the service of an order as set forth in Table 96-C, a bulletin may be issued to the owner as shown upon the last equalized assessment roll of a building considered by the Building Official to be within the scope of this Chapter. The bulletin may contain information the Building Official deems appropriate. The bulletin may be issued by mail or in person. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.2 Order—priority of service. Priorities for the service of the order for buildings within the scope of this Chapter shall be in accordance with the rating classification as shown in Table 96-C. Within each separate rating classification, the priority of the order shall normally be based on the occupant load of the building. The owner of buildings housing the largest occupant loads shall be served first. The minimum time period prior to the service of the order as shown in Table 96-C shall be measured from the effective date of this Chapter. The Building Official may, upon receipt of a written request from the owner, order such owner to bring the building into compliance with this Chapter prior to the normal service date for such building set forth in this Chapter. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.3 Order—contents. The order shall be in writing and shall be served either personally or by certified or registered mail upon the owner as shown on the last equalized assessment roll of the building. The order shall specify that the building has been determined by the Building Official to be within the scope of this Chapter and, therefore, is required to meet the minimum seismic standards of this Chapter. The order shall specify the rating classification of the building and shall be accompanied by a copy of [Section 9605](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH96EAHAREEXUNMABEWABU_S9605GERE) which sets forth the owner's alternatives and time limits for compliance. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.4 Appeal from order. The owner of the building may appeal the Building Official's initial determination that the building is within the scope of this Chapter to the Building Board of Appeals established by [Section 105](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH1AD_S105APBO). Such appeal shall be filed with the Board within 60 days from the service date of the order described in Section 9606.3. Any such appeal shall be decided by the Board no later than 90 days after the date that the appeal is filed. Such appeal shall be made in writing and the grounds thereof shall be stated clearly and concisely. Appeals or requests for modifications from any other determinations, orders or actions by the building official pursuant to this Chapter shall be made in accordance with the procedures established in Sections 104.2.7 and 105. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.5 Recordation. At the time that the Building Official serves the aforementioned order, the Building Official shall also file with the office of the County Recorder a certificate stating that the subject building is within the scope of this Chapter and is a potentially earthquake hazardous building. The certificate shall also state that the owner thereof has been ordered to structurally analyze the building and to structurally alter or demolish the building where compliance with this Chapter has not been demonstrated. If the building is either demolished, found not to be within the scope of this Chapter, or is structurally capable of resisting minimum seismic forces required by this Chapter as a result of structural alterations or an analysis, the Building Official shall file with the office of the County Recorder a form terminating the status of the subject building as being classified within the scope of this Chapter. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.6 Abatement orders. If the owner of the subject building fails to comply with any order issued by the Building Official pursuant to this Chapter within any of the time limits set forth in [Section 9605](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH96EAHAREEXUNMABEWABU_S9605GERE), then the Building Official shall verify that the record owner of this building has been properly served. If the order has been served on the record owner, then the Building Official may order that the entire building be vacated and that the building remain vacated until such order has been complied with. If compliance with such order has not been accomplished within 90 days after the date the building has been ordered vacated or such additional time as may have been granted by the Building Board of Appeals, then the Building Official may order its demolition in accordance with the provisions of Section 102.1 of this Code. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.7 Hearing. An owner who has been served with an abatement order as described in Section 9606.6 may request a hearing before the Building Board of Appeals to request postponement of County action leading to demolition, vacation of building, or other abatement procedure. All such requests shall be accompanied by a rehearing fee as specified in [Section 105](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT26BUCO_CH1AD_S105APBO). At such a rehearing, the Board will consider all evidence submitted and after such consideration may find that a postponement is warranted and so order, or may find that further postponement is unwarranted and order any abatement work considered necessary to be performed by a specified date after which date the Building Official shall cause such work to be performed or completed without further notice. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the Board itself or the Building Official from bringing any matter before the Board for rehearing. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.8 Violation. It shall be unlawful to own, use, occupy, maintain, or be in control of a building for which an order requiring compliance with this Chapter has been served where said order has not been complied with. (Ord. 2010-0053 § 83, 2010.) #### 9606.9 Prosecution.

Such person may request a hearing before the Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board. The request must be made in writing to the Board within 10 days of the receipt of the copy of the notice of substandard building or property.

If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land within such time period, this statement shall be construed as a request for hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. If such a request is not received within such period, the Building Official shall have the authority to remove the vehicle. (Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.) #### 9917.3 All persons described in Section 9917.1 above shall be notified that prior to abatement of the public nuisance by the County, they are entitled to a hearing before the Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board.
